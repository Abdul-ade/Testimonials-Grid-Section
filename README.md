    <img
      src="images/image-jonathan.jpg"
      alt="Photo of Jonathan"
      class="item-img"
    />
    <div>
      <h6 class="name">Jonathan Walters</h6>
      <p class="title">Verified Graduate</p>
    </div>
  </hgroup>
  <p class="item-text">The team was very supportive and kept me motivated.</p>

  <blockquote class="item-quote">
    ‚Äú I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills. I now work as
    a mobile engineer for a big company. This was one of the best investments
    I‚Äôve made in myself. ‚Äù
  </blockquote>
</article>
```

```css
.item:nth-child(1)::before {
  content: "\201d";

  opacity: 0.2;
}
```
